# IsThisTriangle

Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c.

#### The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

---

In the program I use the **Triangle Inequality Theorem**, which states that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle is always greater than the third side. If this is true for all three combinations of added side lengths, then you will have a triangle.
